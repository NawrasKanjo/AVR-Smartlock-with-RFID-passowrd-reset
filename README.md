# AVR-Smartlock-with-RFID-passowrd-reset
This project is done with C, it is a passcode lock that opens when you enter the right password. The lock is represented in a servo motor. 
There are LEDs that indicate the state of the lock, and blink when you press a key on the numberpad. 
If you want to change the password, you need to use a RFID card with a specific ID. If the card is correct, you may enter a code that becomes that current code of the lock.
